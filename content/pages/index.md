i work on developer experience tools and processes while leading teams to build elegant, responsive, and speedy software and websites at [graveflex](https://graveflex.com). i mostly work across the stack, and love thinking project architecture, design systems, and component libraries. on the side i'm working on [garden](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs/garden-monorepo), which are a suite of tools for digital gardening.

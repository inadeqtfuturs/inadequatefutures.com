hi. ðŸŒ±  i'm alex christie and i make things online. in my past life, i taught english literature and wrote about [ethics](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/749540/pdf), [futurity](https://reallifemag.com/smooth-talk/), and [posthumanism](https://asapjournal.com/stacy-alaimos-exposed-environmental-politics-and-pleasures-in-posthuman-times-alex-christie/). i'm trained as an educator and researcher, so i'm eager to learn new things and teach others.

currently, i'm a senior software engineer at [limber health](https://www.limberhealth.com), where i work on react native, react, and serverless node projects, and help create products that enhance patient care and engagement.

~~currently, i'm a lead software engineer working on developer experience and leading teams to build web sites, custom CMSs, and saas products at [graveflex](https://graveflex.com).~~

~~currently, i'm a frontend developer at [relay care](https://relaycareapp.com/), where i work on react native and react apps.~~

on the side, i work on and think about design systems, component libraries, and digital gardening. some projects i've worked on include [if-sf](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs/if-sf), a theme generator and component library, an mdx library for next.js called [next-mdx-relations](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs/next-mdx-relations) (which i'm dogfooding on this site), and [digital-garden.dev](https://digital-garden.dev). i'm currently centralizing these tools into [garden](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs/garden-monorepo), and you can find me writing about the process both here (under 'garden') and on github.

you can find me on [github](https://github.com/inadeqtfuturs), [twitter](https://twitter.com/speculative_dev), and [polywork](https://www.polywork.com/inadeqt_futurs).

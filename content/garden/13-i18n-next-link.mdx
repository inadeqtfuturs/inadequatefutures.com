excerpt: automatic internationalized links and routing using NextJS's Link component and app router
draft: false
---

Yesterday, I posted about [implementing i18n routing in a nextjs project](/garden/12-i18n-nextjs), focusing on the `app` folder and middleware setup. This post follows from that post with an `I18NLink` component that leverages our i18n set up to automatically prefix your links with the user's current language. This way, you can do something like this:

``` typescript
<I18NLink href="/settings">{t('settings', 'Settings')}</I18NLink>
```

And the link will automatically pick up the `lang` param to route to either `/settings` or (for example) `/es/settings` depending on the `lang` in the url.

Note: the `t` function is a stand in for a generic translation function that would take a key like `settings` and return a string or fallback to the second argument, which is "Settings".

## wrapping the `Link` component

The first thing we need to do is wrap NextJS's default `Link` component:

``` typescript
import type { ComponentProps } from 'react';
import React from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

export type I18NLinkType = Omit<ComponentProps<typeof Link>, 'as'> & {
  href: string;
};

function I18NLink({ children, href, ...props }: I18NLinkType) {
  return (
    <Link href={href} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

A few things are happening here:

1. We are creating a new `I18NLinkType` by taking the `Link` type and omitting `as` so we can use the component polymorphically.
2. We are defining `href` as a string since `Link` potentially accepts a `URL`.
3. We then create a function that's more or less a pass-through: take the `href` and `children` and just pass them to `Link`.

This isn't doing too much yet. We need to hook it into the `useParams` hook.

## get current `lang` param

Let's update the component:

``` typescript
import { useParams } from 'next/navigation';

// generic import of your default language
import { defaultLanguage } from 'settings';

function I18NLink({ children, href, ...props }: I18NLinkType) {
  const params = useParams();
  const currentLanguage = (params?.lang as string) || defaultLanguage;

  return (
    <Link href={`${currentLanguage}${href}`} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

Note that `params` could be `null` or an empty `Record`, so we want to coerce `lang` as a string.

This isn't a bad solution, but we're going to run into a few problems:

1. We don't want to prepend the `defaultLanguage` if we don't have to since it'll cause an extra redirect in the middleware.
2. We can't use the Link generically since it'll only work for relative paths. If we pass an absolute or external route, the url will be malformed.

## checking incoming href

What we need to do to prevent the above is check the incoming `href` and make decisions about what `href` to actually pass to `Link`.

``` typescript
function getPath(path?: string | null) {
  // 1.
  if (!path) {
    return ['en', ''];
  }

  // 2.
  const pathArray = path.split('/').filter((x) => !!x);

  // 3. empty array
  if (pathArray.length === 0) {
    return ['en', ''];
  }

  // 4.
  const [lang, ...restPath] = pathArray;

  // 5.
  if (languageArray.includes(lang)) {
    return [lang, restPath.join('/')];
  }

  // 6.
  return ['en', pathArray.join('/')];
}


function getPrefixedUrl(href: string, currentLanguage: string) {
  // 1. handle absolute links
  if (/^((http|https):\/\/)/.test(href)) {
    return href;
  }

  // 2.
  const [, tail] = getPath(href);

  // 3.
  if (currentLanguage === defaultLanguage) {
    return `/${tail}`;
  }

  // 4.
  return `/${currentLanguage}/${tail}`;
}
```

Let's start with `getPrefixedUrl`:

1. If the `href` starts with `http` or `https`, we should follow the absolute route provided.
2. Otherwise, we want to get the url path without the `lang` param if it's provided.
3. If the `currentLanguage` is also the default language, just pass the `tail` of the path
4. Otherwise, prepend the current language to the `tail` of the path

`getPath` might seem a little extraneous or verbose, but it's meant to help avoid issues with passing around the root and with overriding the `lang` provided in the url.

1. If the `path` is null, return an array we can use to route the user to the root of the site.
2. Take the path, and split it at `/`. The array is going to be easier to work with.
3. If the array is empty because `path === '/'`, return an array we can use to route the user to the root of the site. 
4. We want to deal with just `restPath` if (and only if) the first part of the url is actually an `lang` param.
5. We do a check to ensure that `lang` is include in our `langaugeArray`, which tells us we can safely use `restPath`
6. Otherwise we want to return the whole path we were provided

With these helper functions, we can update the component:

``` typescript
function I18NLink({ children, href, ...props }: I18NLinkType) {
  const params = useParams();
  const currentLanguage = (params?.lang as string) || defaultLanguage;
  const prefixedHref = getPrefixedUrl(href, currentLanguage);
  return (
    <Link href={prefixedHref} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

### bonus: anchor or `Link`

If you want to escape the client cache with a "hard" route, you might want to be able to use *either* an anchor or `Link` component:

``` typescript
export type I18NLinkType = Omit<ComponentProps<typeof Link>, 'as'> & {
  isAnchor?: boolean;
  href: string;
};

function I18NLink({ children, href, isAnchor, ...props }: I18NLinkType) {
  const params = useParams();
  const currentLanguage = (params?.lang as string) || defaultLanguage;
  const prefixedHref = getPrefixedUrl(href, currentLanguage);
  if (isAnchor) {
    return (
      <a href={prefixedHref} {...props}>
        {children}
      </a>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Link href={prefixedHref} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

We can just use a `boolean` and render an anchor tag based on `isAnchor` if passed.

## wrapping up

It would be great to have a more built in way to handle internationalization in NextJS, however it only requires a little bit of boilerplate to get a full fledged i18n setup, including automatic i18n routing with NextJS's default `Link` component.
